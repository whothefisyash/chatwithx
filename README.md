# Chat with X - A Generative AI-powered Chatbot
### Chat with X is a generative AI-powered application that allows users to interact with various data sources such as GitHub repositories, PDF documents, and emails (Gmail) to extract meaningful information, ask questions, and receive context-aware answers.

The goal of this project is to create a multi-modal conversational interface where users can:

<br>Chat with GitHub: Retrieve repository details and interact with GitHub data.
<br>Chat with PDFs: Extract text from uploaded PDF documents and ask questions based on the document's content.
<br>Chat with Gmail: (optional) Integrate email queries (if needed) for communication insights (though not implemented yet).
